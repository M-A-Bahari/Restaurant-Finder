# AI Usage Disclosure

Used to disclose AI use. Please see the course [syllabus](https://cs-3035-2025.github.io/en_CA/#!pages/CS3035-fall-syllabus.md).


## Disclosure
Large Language Model was used in order to write and format the REPORT.md file with clear, concise language and proper indentation of technical descriptions. After using this tool/service, the author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed and take full responsibility. The author(s) believe this fits into the course regulations for AI use because the AI was used only for documentation writing and improving clarity, not for implementing the core application logic or solving technical problems.

### Note
I used a Large Language Model to help with writing and formatting the REPORT.md file. Specifically, the AI was used to:
- Make the report content clear and concise
- Paraphrase technical descriptions
- Improve the overall writing quality and structure of the documentation
